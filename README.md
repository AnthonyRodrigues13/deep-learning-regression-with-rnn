# Deep Learning Regression with RNN

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using Keras for regression tasks.  
It includes data preprocessing with Pandas, model construction using LSTM/GRU layers, training, and performance evaluation.

## Features
- Uses Keras for deep learning model development
- Implements LSTM/GRU networks for sequential data regression
- Includes data handling and visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
- Integrates Scikit-learn for model evaluation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Keras / TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess data.
2. Define and train the RNN model.
3. Evaluate regression performance using standard metrics.
4. Visualize training progress and predictions.
